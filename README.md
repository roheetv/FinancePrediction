#Financial Performance Prediction Competition
---------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Financial Performance Prediction competition hosted by Synnax! This competition presents an exciting opportunity for data enthusiasts to demonstrate their skills in predicting financial indicators for private companies operating in the web3 domain. By participating, you not only contribute to advancing machine learning approaches in finance but also stand a chance to be a part of Synnax's production pipeline with potential monthly profit sharing.

Overview
--------
In this competition, we've utilized the Kaggle competition API to conveniently load the dataset in a zip file, simplifying the data acquisition process. After loading the data, we embarked on a rigorous journey of data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the quality and consistency of our dataset.

Our predictive modeling strategy involved employing four distinct models:

1. Linear Regression: Leveraging the simplicity and interpretability of linear relationships to predict financial indicators.
2. Random Forest: Harnessing the power of ensemble learning for robust predictions through decision tree aggregation.
3. Gradient Boosting: Utilizing boosting techniques to sequentially improve upon weak learners for enhanced prediction accuracy.
4. SVR (Support Vector Regression): Leveraging support vector machines for regression to capture complex relationships in the data.
Model Comparison and Visualization
Following the training and testing of our models, we conducted a comprehensive comparison to evaluate their performance. Utilizing metrics such as R-squared and mean squared error, we assessed the effectiveness of each model in predicting the financial indicators accurately.

To provide a clear understanding of the comparative performance, we visualized the results using insightful plots and graphs, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

Predictions and Submission
-------------------------
After careful evaluation, we selected the most promising model(s) and proceeded to make predictions for future financial values. These predictions were then stored in a separate submission Excel file, ready for evaluation and submission to the competition platform.
